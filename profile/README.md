# AI-Tournaments
[AI-Tournaments](https://ai-tournaments.github.io/AI-Tournaments/) is still in an early prototype stage. See the section on [`Participate`](https://github.com/AI-Tournaments/AI-Tournaments#Participate) if you want to join a arena, then analyze how other have solved the arena until better documentation has been written. The name of the repository will be the name used in the arena, except if it starts with `AI-Tournaments-Participant-` then that part is removed.
