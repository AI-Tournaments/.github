# AI-Tournaments
[AI-Tournaments](https://ai-tournaments.github.io/) is about match making between algorithms. Users can make their own participates to any of the existing arenas, or make their own custom arena and challenge other users to join.

AI-Tournaments in an early prototype stage. See the section [Participate](#Participate) if you want to join a arena, then analyze how other have solved the arena until better documentation has been written.

## Why Source Available?
[AI-Tournaments](https://github.com/AI-Tournaments) is not Open Source by the [Open Source Initiative's definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) but rather [Source Available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software), except were a license that says otherwise is in place.
### User written JavaScript
AI-Tournaments executes user written JavaScripts in the web browser, which is usually seen as a security concern ([Cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)). But the scripts are loaded into a sandbox IFrame and Web Worker to prevent just that. But the concern still remain and that's a fact that should not be hidden, that is why it is instead addressed and displayed publicly here.

But if you do find a way to break out of the sandbox and access client data or other participant scripts, please do [report it](https://github.com/AI-Tournaments/AI-Tournaments.github.io/issues/new?title=%5Bsecurity-hole%5D%20_Short_description_&body=How%20to%20reproduce:%0A1.%20First...%0A2.%20Then...)! Reporters of confirmed security holes will get a [honorable mention](https://ai-tournaments.github.io/Community/HonorableMentions/) once the hole is fixed.
### Scheduled server hosted events
A server-side events with official match results is planned, but until then client-side execution is the only way to run the arenas.
Note that [interfaces](#Interfaces) will not be able or allowed to compete.
